      <p>Trazyn is a preserver of histories, artefacts and events, and often "liberates" what he wants from other alien races or even his fellow Necrons so that the treasures may be preserved in his galleries.</p>
      <p>Come be a Trazyn of your own making; we meet weekly in order to discuss, collect and paint figures belonging to the 40k universe with a special focus on Necrons.</p>

        <h2>Paints</h2>
        <p>For the traditional Necron look, we suggest picking up this paint set; if you can't get them all in one go, don't fret! We have communal paints available as well.</p>
